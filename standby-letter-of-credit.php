                        client that is used as
                        "payment of last resort" should the client fail to fulfill a contractual commitment with a third
                        party.</h2>

                    <p>Standby letters of credit are created as a sign of good faith in business transactions and are
                        proof of a buyersâ€™ credit
                        quality and repayment abilities.</p>
                    <p>The institution issuing the SBLC performs compliance and brief underwriting duties to ensure the
                        credit quality of the
                        party seeking the letter of credit, then sends notification to the bank of the party requesting
                        the letter of credit
                        (typically a seller or creditor).</p>
                    <p>Importantly, when requesting a SBLC, a business owner proves to the bank he is capable of
                        repaying the loan. Collateral
                        such as promissory notes, post-dated cheques and Escrow deposits will be required to protect the
                        bank in case of
                        default. The business owner must pay a SBLC fee for each year that the letter is valid. The
                        negotiable fee is typically
                        5-10% of the SBLC value.
