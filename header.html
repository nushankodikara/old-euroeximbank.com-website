                                <p>1. Euro Exim Bank will allow withdrawals or payments from my account if I
                                    have enough available money
                                    in my account, or enough unused Arranged Overdraft, to cover the withdrawal

                                <p>2. Euro Exim Bank must be provided with the following Payment Details:</p>

                                <p>c. You must provide us with all of the following details (â€˜International
                                    Identifierâ€™) to enable us to
                                    make an International Payment: a) the recipientâ€™s bank name, address,
                                    routing code and correct Bank

                                <p>3. Euro Exim Bank will be treated as having received a Payment Instruction
                                    from me (or, if
                                    applicable, the person requesting a payment from me) at the time that
                                    instruction is actually
                                    received by Euro Exim Bank, except:</p>

                                <p>a. If Euro Exim Bank receives the Payment Instruction on a non-working day,
                                    then it will be treated
                                    as having been received on the following working day. If my Payment
                                    Instruction is an instruction to
                                    withdraw cash using my card and PIN from a cash machine or an instruction
                                    made using a card and PIN,
                                    it will be treated as having been received by Euro Exim Bank at the time
                                    that instruction is
                                    actually received by us; or </p>

                                <p>b. If the Payment Instruction is received by us after 5pm, it will be treated
                                    as having been received
                                    on the following working; or </p>

                                <p>c. If my Payment Instruction specifies that the payment is to take place on a
                                    specific day or on the
                                    last day of a certain period, then Euro Exim Bank will treat it as having
                                    been received on the day
                                    specified, unless that day is a non-working day (in which case the following
                                    working day will
                                    apply).</p>


                                <h3>Processing of Payment Instructions</h3>
                                <p>1. You can request certain payments through the Service. When I have provided
                                    my instruction, I will
                                    be asked to confirm it, which will be my agreement for Euro Exim Bank to
                                    make the payment.
                                </p>
                                <p>2. I request and authorise Euro Exim Bank to:
                                </p>
                                <p>a. Rely and act upon all apparently valid payment or transfer instructions as
                                    properly authorised
                                    through the Service, even if it may conflict with any other mandate given at
                                    any time concerning you
                                    account(s) or affairs, and</p>
                                <p>b. Debit my account(s) with any amount I have paid, transferred or incurred
                                    in accordance with the
                                    instruction.</p>

                                <p>3. My payment instructions will only be accepted by Euro Exim Bank after my
                                    Security Details have
                                    been accepted and it passes any further authenticity checks.</p>

                                <p>4. Euro Exim Bank may refuse to act upon a payment instruction, for example,
                                    if it exceeds the limit
                                    that Euro Exim Bank has set for such an instruction, or if Euro Exim Bank
                                    knows of or suspects a
                                    breach of my Security Details. If Euro Exim Bank decided to decrease my
                                    default maximum limits at
                                    any time, Euro Exim Bank will override any limits that may be above my new
                                    maximum limits. To
                                    increase you limits at any time, please call Euro Exim Bank.</p>


                                <p>5. Euro Exim Bank will not be responsible if the circumstances giving rise to
                                    an incorrect payment or
                                    transfer, or a payment or transfer not being made were due to abnormal and
                                    unforeseeable
                                    circumstances beyond Euro Exim Bankâ€™s control, the consequences of which
                                    would have been unavoidable
                                    despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>

                                <p>6. Euro Exim Bank may, at any time, suspend my access to the Service. Euro
                                    Exim Bank will normally
                                    give you advance notice if Euro Exim Bank is going to suspend you use of the
                                    Service.</p>

                                <p>7. Euro Exim Bank will tell you why we are taking this action, but Euro Exim
                                    Bank will not give me
                                    notice or details of the reason for the suspension if this would compromise
                                    Euro Exim Bankâ€™s
                                    reasonable security measures, or if it is unlawful to do so. Euro Exim Bank
                                    may occasionally suspend
                                    my use of the Service without notifying me where Euro Exim Bank has been
                                    unable to contact me in
                                    advance. Euro Exim Bank may also suspend my use of the Service due to local
                                    legal obligations that
                                    applies to Euro Exim Bank.</p>

                                <p>8. Euro Exim Bank will use reasonable efforts to inform me without undue
                                    delay through the Service
                                    and/or our website, if any service under the Service is not available.</p>

                                <p>9. Euro Exim Bank will not always carry out a payment or transfer instruction
                                    immediately following
                                    it being requested by me. Some matters may take time to process and my
                                    instruction may only be
                                    processed during normal banking hours.</p>


                                <h3>Payment Limits</h3>
                                <p>1. Maximum daily limits apply to the amount of cash I can withdraw using my
                                    card.</p>

                                <p>2. Euro Exim Bank can refuse any withdrawal or payment from my account, if:
                                </p>
                                <p>a. I do not have enough available money in my account; </p>
                                <p>b. I have exceeded my maximum daily withdrawal; </p>
                                <p>c. It may place Euro Exim Bank in breach of any legislation or law;</p>
                                <p>d. Euro exim Bank suspects it relates to fraud or any other criminal act
                                </p>
                                <p>e. I am in breach of any of these Conditions.</p>
                                <p>3. If Euro Exim Bank refuses to allow a withdrawal or payment from my
                                    Account, Euro Exim Bank will
                                    tell me the following by the end of the next working day after the day Euro
                                    Exim Bank receives my
                                    withdrawal or payment request; </p>
                                <p>a. That Euro Exim Bank has done so;</p>
                                <p>b. The reason why Euro Exim Bank refused; and </p>
                                <p> c. If I think Euro Exim Bank has based its decision on mistaken information,
                                    how I can ask Euro Exim
                                    Bank to rectify that mistake.
                                    Euro Exim Bank will not tell me that they are refusing a payment or
                                    withdrawal if the law prevents
                                    Euro Exim Bank from doing so.</p>

                                    person who is authorized to sign the mandate whether or not that person has
                                    signed the original
                                    payment instruction.</p>
                                <p>b. The partners authorize the Bank to make advances with or without security
                                    by way of overdraft,

                                    in accordance with the
                                    mandate, and to discount bills or promissory notes on the request of the
                                    partners for the time being
                                    made in accordance with the mandate.</p>
                                <p>c. The partners authorize the Bank to accept by way of pledge or deposit as
                                    security or for safe

                                    partners for the time being
                                    made in accordance with the mandate, and to deliver upon the said
                                    instructions anything as accepted
                                    or held on account of the partnership.</p>
                                <p>d. All liability of the partners to the Bank is joint and several.
                                </p>
                                <p>e. Upon any change in the constitution of the partnership, the partners will
                                    sign a new mandate.</p>
                                <p>f. A mandate remains in force and may be acted upon by the Bank until it has
                                    either been revoked in
                                    writing by all or any of the signatories or until it has been replaced by a
                                    new mandate and such
                                    revocation or new mandate has reached the Bank and not until that event has
                                    happened, the Bank will
                                    be responsible for acting according to the original mandate.</p>

                                <p>1. I must take all reasonable precautions to keep safe and prevent fraudulent

                                    security information. These precautions include:</p>

                                    that can be understood by
                                    someone else;</p>

                                <p>f. Changing my security details immediately and telling Euro Exim Bank as
                                    soon as possible if I know,
                                    or even suspect, that someone else knows my security details, or if Euro
                                    Exim Bank asks me to;</p>
                                <p>g. Keeping my security details and devices safe;</p>
                                <p>h. Complying with all reasonable instructions we issue regarding keeping my

                                <p>i. Once I have logged onto the online banking platform, I will not leave my
                                    devices unattended or let
                                    anyone else use my devices;</p>
                                <p>j. Logging out of my devices once I have finished using the online banking
                                    platform services and, in

                                <p>k. I will never disclose my security details to them or information about my
                                    accounts with Euro Exim
                                    Bank;</p>

                                    or other destructive
                                    properties.</p>
                                <p>2. I must not use the online banking platform on any device or operating
                                    system that has been
                                    modified outside its operating system vendor supported or warranted
                                    configurations. This includes
                                    devices that have been â€œjail-brokenâ€ or â€œrootedâ€.</p>

                                <p>3. Euro Exim Bank will never contact me after initial registration (or ask
                                    anyone to do so on Euro
                                    Exim Bankâ€™s behalf) with a request to disclose my security details in full.
                                    If I receive any such
                                    request from anyone (even if they are using Euro Exim Bankâ€™s name and logo
                                    and appear to be genuine)
                                    then I will not supply my security details to them in any circumstances.
                                    Additionally, I will report
                                    any such requests to Euro Exim Bank immediately.</p>

                                <p>4. I will be responsible for all instructions given by me or anyone acting
                                    with my authority between
                                    when I log onto the online banking platform until I log off.</p>

                                <h3>Suspension of Accounts </h3>
                                <p>1. Euro Exim Bank may at its reasonable discretion suspend my operation of
                                    the Account(s) at any time
                                    for any reason whatsoever; including without limitation industrial actions,

                                <p>2. I agree that Euro Exim Bank may block any payment or transaction with
                                    respect to the Account where
                                    such payment or transaction would result in Euro Exim Bank or Third Party
                                    Service Provider being in
                                    breach of Law or Regulation.</p>
                                <h3>Freezing of Accounts</h3>
                                <p>1. Euro Exim Bank may at any time freeze any of my accounts if and so long as
                                    there is any dispute or

                                    doubt.</p>
                                <h3>Closing of Accounts </h3>

                                    Exim Bankâ€™s entire
                                    Liability. </p>

                                <p>2. If I choose to terminate any of my Account(s) held with Euro Exim Bank, I
                                    am required to give Euro
                                    Exim Bank reasonable notice of termination or such other period of notice
                                    which Euro Exim Bank may

                                <p>3. On the termination of my Account(s):- (a) Euro Exim Bank may discharge my
                                    entire Liability with

                                    transfer to me such claims as Euro Exim Bank may have on such funds, or, at
                                    Euro Exim Bankâ€™s option,
                                    by delivering to my Account(s) or (as the case may be) to a Joint Account of
                                    all Account(s)
                                    holder(s) of the Account(s), any Alternative Financial Instrument as
                                    selected by me in my sole
                                    discretion; and (b) Euro Exim Bank may, at my own cost and expense, transfer
                                    all my Securities to me

                                <p>4. If Euro Exim Bank has effected a forward or any other transaction which
                                    extends beyond the date of
                                    termination, Euro Exim Bank may either close out or complete such

                                    funds for this purpose. Any security interest or set-off contained in an
