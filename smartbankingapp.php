                                            applicable, the person requesting a payment from me) at the time that
                                            instruction is actually
                                            received by Euro Exim Bank, except:</p>

                                        <p>a. if Euro Exim Bank receives the Payment Instruction on a non-working day,
                                            then it will be
                                            treated as having been received on the following working day. If my Payment
                                            Instruction is an
                                            instruction to withdraw cash using my card and PIN from a cash machine or an
                                            instruction made
                                            using a card and PIN, it will be treated as having been received by Euro
                                            Exim Bank at the time
                                            that instruction is actually received by us; or </p>

                                        <p>b. If the Payment Instruction is received by us after 5pm, it will be treated
                                            as having been
                                            received on the following working; or </p>

                                        <p>c. If my Payment Instruction specifies that the payment is to take place on a
                                            specific day or on
                                            the last day of a certain period, then Euro Exim Bank will treat it as
                                            having been received on
                                            the day specified, unless that day is a non-working day (in which case the
                                            following working day
                                            will apply).</p>


                                        <h3>Processing of Payment Instructions</h3>
                                        <p>1. You can request certain payments through the Service. When I have provided
                                            my instruction, I
                                            will be asked to confirm it, which will be my agreement for Euro Exim Bank
                                            to make the payment.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>2. I request and authorise Euro Exim Bank to:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. Rely and act upon all apparently valid payment or transfer instructions as
                                            properly authorised
                                            through the Service, even if it may conflict with any other mandate given at
                                            any time concerning
                                            you account(s) or affairs, and</p>
                                        <p>b. Debit my account(s) with any amount I have paid, transferred or incurred
                                            in accordance with
                                            the instruction.</p>

                                        <p>3. My payment instructions will only be accepted by Euro Exim Bank after my
                                            Security Details have
                                            been accepted and it passes any further authenticity checks.</p>

                                        <p>4. Euro Exim Bank may refuse to act upon a payment instruction, for example,
                                            if it exceeds the
                                            limit that Euro Exim Bank has set for such an instruction, or if Euro Exim
                                            Bank knows of or
                                            suspects a breach of my Security Details. If Euro Exim Bank decided to
                                            decrease my default
                                            maximum limits at any time, Euro Exim Bank will override any limits that may
                                            be above my new
                                            maximum limits. To increase you limits at any time, please call Euro Exim
                                            Bank.</p>


                                        <p>5. Euro Exim Bank will not be responsible if the circumstances giving rise to
                                            an incorrect
                                            payment or transfer, or a payment or transfer not being made were due to
                                            abnormal and
                                            unforeseeable circumstances beyond Euro Exim Bank’s control, the
                                            consequences of which would
                                            have been unavoidable despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>

                                        <p>6. Euro Exim Bank may, at any time, suspend my access to the Service. Euro
                                            Exim Bank will
                                            normally give you advance notice if Euro Exim Bank is going to suspend you
                                            use of the Service.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>7. Euro Exim Bank will tell you why we are taking this action, but Euro Exim
                                            Bank will not give
                                            me notice or details of the reason for the suspension if this would
                                            compromise Euro Exim Bank’s
                                            reasonable security measures, or if it is unlawful to do so. Euro Exim Bank
                                            may occasionally
                                            suspend my use of the Service without notifying me where Euro Exim Bank has
                                            been unable to
                                            contact me in advance. Euro Exim Bank may also suspend my use of the Service
                                            due to local legal
                                            obligations that applies to Euro Exim Bank.</p>

                                        <p>8. Euro Exim Bank will use reasonable efforts to inform me without undue
                                            delay through the
                                            Service and/or our website, if any service under the Service is not
                                            available.</p>

                                        <p>9. Euro Exim Bank will not always carry out a payment or transfer instruction
                                            immediately
                                            following it being requested by me. Some matters may take time to process
                                            and my instruction may
                                            only be processed during normal banking hours.</p>


                                        <h3>Payment Limits</h3>
                                        <p>1. Maximum daily limits apply to the amount of cash I can withdraw using my
                                            card.</p>

                                        <p>2. Euro Exim Bank can refuse any withdrawal or payment from my account, if:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. I do not have enough available money in my account; </p>
                                        <p>b. I have exceeded my maximum daily withdrawal; </p>
                                        <p>c. It may place Euro Exim Bank in breach of any legislation or law;</p>
                                        <p>d. Euro exim Bank suspects it relates to fraud or any other criminal act
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. I am in breach of any of these Conditions.</p>
                                        If Euro Exim Bank refuses to allow a withdrawal or payment from my Account, Euro
                                        Exim Bank will tell
                                        me the following by the end of the next working day after the day Euro Exim Bank
                                        receives my
                                        withdrawal or payment request; <p></p>
                                        <p>a. That Euro Exim Bank has done so;</p>
                                        <p>b. The reason why Euro Exim Bank refused; and </p>
                                        <p>c. If I think Euro Exim Bank has based its decision on mistaken information,
                                            how I can ask Euro
                                            Exim Bank to rectify that mistake.
                                            Euro Exim Bank will not tell me that they are refusing a payment or
                                            withdrawal if the law
                                            prevents Euro Exim Bank from doing so.</p>

                                            by way of overdraft,
                                            loan or any other manner on the request of partners for the time being made
                                            in accordance with

                                            security or for safe

                                            partners for the time
                                            being made in accordance with the mandate, and to deliver upon the said
                                            instructions anything as
                                            accepted or held on account of the partnership.</p>
                                        <p>d. All liability of the partners to the Bank is joint and several.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. Upon any change in the constitution of the partnership, the partners will
                                            sign a new mandate.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>f. A mandate remains in force and may be acted upon by the Bank until it has
                                            either been revoked
                                            in writing by all or any of the signatories or until it has been replaced by
                                            a new mandate and
                                            such revocation or new mandate has reached the Bank and not until that event
                                            has happened, the
                                            Bank will be responsible for acting according to the original mandate.</p>

                                        <p>Euro Exim Bank will be treated as having received a Payment Instruction from

                                            the person requesting a payment from me) at the time that instruction is
                                            actually received by Euro
                                            Exim Bank, except:</p>

                                        <p>a. If Euro Exim Bank receives the Payment Instruction on a non-working day,
                                            then it will be treated
                                            as having been received on the following working day. If my Payment
                                            Instruction is an instruction to
                                            withdraw cash using my card and PIN from a cash machine or an instruction
                                            made using a card and PIN,
                                            it will be treated as having been received by Euro Exim Bank at the time
                                            that instruction is
                                            actually received by us; or </p>

                                        <p>b. If the Payment Instruction is received by us after 5pm, it will be treated
                                            as having been received
                                            on the following working; or </p>

                                        <p>c. If my Payment Instruction specifies that the payment is to take place on a
                                            specific day or on the
                                            last day of a certain period, then Euro Exim Bank will treat it as having
                                            been received on the day
                                            specified, unless that day is a non-working day (in which case the following
                                            working day will
                                            apply).</p>


                                        <h3>Processing of Payment Instructions</h3>
                                        <p>1. You can request certain payments through the Service. When I have provided
                                            my instruction, I will
                                            be asked to confirm it, which will be my agreement for Euro Exim Bank to
                                            make the payment.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>2. I request and authorise Euro Exim Bank to:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. Rely and act upon all apparently valid payment or transfer instructions as
                                            properly authorised
                                            through the Service, even if it may conflict with any other mandate given at
                                            any time concerning you
                                            account(s) or affairs, and</p>
                                        <p>b. Debit my account(s) with any amount I have paid, transferred or incurred
                                            in accordance with the
                                            instruction.</p>

                                        <p>3. My payment instructions will only be accepted by Euro Exim Bank after my
                                            Security Details have
                                            been accepted and it passes any further authenticity checks.</p>

                                        <p>4. Euro Exim Bank may refuse to act upon a payment instruction, for example,
                                            if it exceeds the limit
                                            that Euro Exim Bank has set for such an instruction, or if Euro Exim Bank
                                            knows of or suspects a
                                            breach of my Security Details. If Euro Exim Bank decided to decrease my
                                            default maximum limits at
                                            any time, Euro Exim Bank will override any limits that may be above my new
                                            maximum limits. To
                                            increase you limits at any time, please call Euro Exim Bank.</p>


                                        <p>5. Euro Exim Bank will not be responsible if the circumstances giving rise to
                                            an incorrect payment or
                                            transfer, or a payment or transfer not being made were due to abnormal and
                                            unforeseeable
                                            circumstances beyond Euro Exim Bank’s control, the consequences of which
                                            would have been unavoidable
                                            despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>

                                        <p>6. Euro Exim Bank may, at any time, suspend my access to the Service. Euro
                                            Exim Bank will normally
                                            give you advance notice if Euro Exim Bank is going to suspend you use of the
                                            Service.</p>

                                        <p>7. Euro Exim Bank will tell you why we are taking this action, but Euro Exim
                                            Bank will not give me
                                            notice or details of the reason for the suspension if this would compromise
                                            Euro Exim Bank’s
                                            reasonable security measures, or if it is unlawful to do so. Euro Exim Bank
                                            may occasionally suspend
                                            my use of the Service without notifying me where Euro Exim Bank has been
                                            unable to contact me in

                                        <p>9. Euro Exim Bank will not always carry out a payment or transfer instruction
                                            immediately following
                                            it being requested by me. Some matters may take time to process and my
                                            instruction may only be
                                            processed during normal banking hours.</p>

                                            card.</p>

                                        <p>2. Euro Exim Bank can refuse any withdrawal or payment from my account, if:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. I do not have enough available money in my account; </p>
                                        <p>b. I have exceeded my maximum daily withdrawal; </p>
                                        <p>c. It may place Euro Exim Bank in breach of any legislation or law;</p>
                                        <p>d. Euro exim Bank suspects it relates to fraud or any other criminal act
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. I am in breach of any of these Conditions.</p>
                                        If Euro Exim Bank refuses to allow a withdrawal or payment from my Account, Euro
                                        Exim Bank will tell me
                                        the following by the end of the next working day after the day Euro Exim Bank
                                        receives my withdrawal or
                                        payment request; <p></p>
                                        <p>a. That Euro Exim Bank has done so;</p>
                                        <p>b. The reason why Euro Exim Bank refused; and </p>
                                        <p>c. If I think Euro Exim Bank has based its decision on mistaken information,
                                            how I can ask Euro Exim
                                            Bank to rectify that mistake.
                                            Euro Exim Bank will not tell me that they are refusing a payment or
                                            withdrawal if the law prevents
                                            Euro Exim Bank from doing so.</p>

                                            provisions apply:-</p>
                                        <p>a. The partners authorize the bank to carry out instructions countermanding
                                            payment of cheques, bills
                                            of exchange, promissory notes or other orders for payment when such
                                            instructions are given by any
                                            person who is authorized to sign the mandate whether or not that person has
                                            signed the original
                                            payment instruction.</p>
                                        <p>b. The partners authorize the Bank to make advances with or without security
                                            by way of overdraft,
                                            loan or any other manner on the request of partners for the time being made
                                            in accordance with the
                                            mandate, and to discount bills or promissory notes on the request of the
                                            partners for the time being
                                            made in accordance with the mandate.</p>
                                        <p>c. The partners authorize the Bank to accept by way of pledge or deposit as
                                            security or for safe
                                            custody anything belonging to the partnership on the instructions on the
                                            partners for the time being

                                            sign a new mandate.</p>
                                        <p>f. A mandate remains in force and may be acted upon by the Bank until it has
                                            either been revoked in
                                            writing by all or any of the signatories or until it has been replaced by a

                                            revocation or new mandate has reached the Bank and not until that event has
                                            happened, the Bank will
                                            be responsible for acting according to the original mandate.</p>

                                            the person requesting a payment from me) at the time that instruction is
                                            actually received by Euro
                                            Exim Bank, except:</p>

                                        <p>a. If Euro Exim Bank receives the Payment Instruction on a non-working day,
                                            then it will be treated
                                            as having been received on the following working day. If my Payment
                                            Instruction is an instruction to
                                            withdraw cash using my card and PIN from a cash machine or an instruction
                                            made using a card and PIN,
                                            it will be treated as having been received by Euro Exim Bank at the time
                                            that instruction is
                                            actually received by us; or </p>

                                        <p>b. If the Payment Instruction is received by us after 5pm, it will be treated
                                            as having been received
                                            on the following working; or </p>

                                        <p>c. If my Payment Instruction specifies that the payment is to take place on a
                                            specific day or on the
                                            last day of a certain period, then Euro Exim Bank will treat it as having
                                            been received on the day
                                            specified, unless that day is a non-working day (in which case the following
                                            working day will
                                            apply).</p>


                                        <h3>Processing of Payment Instructions</h3>
                                        <p>1. You can request certain payments through the Service. When I have provided
                                            my instruction, I will
                                            be asked to confirm it, which will be my agreement for Euro Exim Bank to
                                            make the payment.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>2. I request and authorise Euro Exim Bank to:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. Rely and act upon all apparently valid payment or transfer instructions as
                                            properly authorised
                                            through the Service, even if it may conflict with any other mandate given at
                                            any time concerning you
                                            account(s) or affairs, and</p>
                                        <p>b. Debit my account(s) with any amount I have paid, transferred or incurred
                                            in accordance with the
                                            instruction.</p>

                                        <p>3. My payment instructions will only be accepted by Euro Exim Bank after my
                                            Security Details have
                                            been accepted and it passes any further authenticity checks.</p>

                                        <p>4. Euro Exim Bank may refuse to act upon a payment instruction, for example,
                                            if it exceeds the limit
                                            that Euro Exim Bank has set for such an instruction, or if Euro Exim Bank
                                            knows of or suspects a
                                            breach of my Security Details. If Euro Exim Bank decided to decrease my
                                            default maximum limits at
                                            any time, Euro Exim Bank will override any limits that may be above my new
                                            maximum limits. To
                                            increase you limits at any time, please call Euro Exim Bank.</p>


                                        <p>5. Euro Exim Bank will not be responsible if the circumstances giving rise to
                                            an incorrect payment or
                                            transfer, or a payment or transfer not being made were due to abnormal and
                                            unforeseeable
                                            circumstances beyond Euro Exim Bank’s control, the consequences of which
                                            would have been unavoidable
                                            despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>

                                        <p>6. Euro Exim Bank may, at any time, suspend my access to the Service. Euro
                                            Exim Bank will normally
                                            give you advance notice if Euro Exim Bank is going to suspend you use of the
                                            Service.</p>

                                        <p>7. Euro Exim Bank will tell you why we are taking this action, but Euro Exim
                                            Bank will not give me
                                            notice or details of the reason for the suspension if this would compromise
                                            Euro Exim Bank’s
                                            reasonable security measures, or if it is unlawful to do so. Euro Exim Bank
                                            may occasionally suspend
                                            my use of the Service without notifying me where Euro Exim Bank has been
                                            unable to contact me in
                                            advance. Euro Exim Bank may also suspend my use of the Service due to local
                                            legal obligations that
                                            applies to Euro Exim Bank.</p>

                                        <p>8. Euro Exim Bank will use reasonable efforts to inform me without undue
                                            delay through the Service
                                            and/or our website, if any service under the Service is not available.</p>

                                        <p>9. Euro Exim Bank will not always carry out a payment or transfer instruction
                                            immediately following
                                            it being requested by me. Some matters may take time to process and my
                                            instruction may only be
                                            processed during normal banking hours.</p>


                                        <h3>Payment Limits</h3>
                                        <p>1. Maximum daily limits apply to the amount of cash I can withdraw using my
                                            card.</p>

                                        <p>2. Euro Exim Bank can refuse any withdrawal or payment from my account, if:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. I do not have enough available money in my account; </p>
                                        <p>b. I have exceeded my maximum daily withdrawal; </p>
                                        <p>c. It may place Euro Exim Bank in breach of any legislation or law;</p>
                                        <p>d. Euro exim Bank suspects it relates to fraud or any other criminal act
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. I am in breach of any of these Conditions.</p>
                                        If Euro Exim Bank refuses to allow a withdrawal or payment from my Account, Euro
                                        Exim Bank will tell me
                                        the following by the end of the next working day after the day Euro Exim Bank
                                        receives my withdrawal or
                                        payment request; <p></p>
                                        <p>a. That Euro Exim Bank has done so;</p>
                                        <p>b. The reason why Euro Exim Bank refused; and </p>
                                        <p> c. If I think Euro Exim Bank has based its decision on mistaken information,
                                            how I can ask Euro Exim
                                            Bank to rectify that mistake.
                                            Euro Exim Bank will not tell me that they are refusing a payment or
                                            withdrawal if the law prevents
                                            Euro Exim Bank from doing so.</p>

                                        <h3>Joint Accounts</h3>

                                        <p>b. Any mandate intimation, notice, request or letter varying the original
                                            instruction regarding the

                                        <h3>Partnership Accounts</h3>
                                        <p>1. In the event of the Customer being a partnership the following additional
                                            provisions apply:-</p>
                                        <p>a. The partners authorize the bank to carry out instructions countermanding
                                            payment of cheques, bills
                                            of exchange, promissory notes or other orders for payment when such
                                            instructions are given by any
                                            person who is authorized to sign the mandate whether or not that person has
                                            signed the original
                                            payment instruction.</p>
                                        <p>b. The partners authorize the Bank to make advances with or without security
                                            by way of overdraft,
                                            loan or any other manner on the request of partners for the time being made
                                            in accordance with the
                                            mandate, and to discount bills or promissory notes on the request of the
                                            partners for the time being
                                            made in accordance with the mandate.</p>
                                        <p>c. The partners authorize the Bank to accept by way of pledge or deposit as
                                            security or for safe
                                            custody anything belonging to the partnership on the instructions on the
                                            partners for the time being
                                            made in accordance with the mandate, and to deliver upon the said
                                            instructions anything as accepted
                                            or held on account of the partnership.</p>
                                        <p>d. All liability of the partners to the Bank is joint and several.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. Upon any change in the constitution of the partnership, the partners will
                                            sign a new mandate.</p>
                                        <p>f. A mandate remains in force and may be acted upon by the Bank until it has
                                            either been revoked in
                                            writing by all or any of the signatories or until it has been replaced by a
                                            new mandate and such
                                            revocation or new mandate has reached the Bank and not until that event has
                                            happened, the Bank will
                                            be responsible for acting according to the original mandate.</p>

                                        <h3>Security Obligations</h3>

                                            or even suspect, that someone else knows my security details, or if Euro
                                            Exim Bank asks me to;</p>
                                        <p>g. Keeping my security details and devices safe;</p>
                                        <p>h. Complying with all reasonable instructions we issue regarding keeping my

                                        </p>
                                        <p>i. Once I have logged onto the online banking platform, I will not leave my
                                            devices unattended or let
                                            anyone else use my devices;</p>

                                        <p>2. I must not use the online banking platform on any device or operating

                                            configurations. This includes
                                            devices that have been “jail-broken” or “rooted”.</p>

                                        <p>3. Euro Exim Bank will never contact me after initial registration (or ask
                                            anyone to do so on Euro
                                            Exim Bank’s behalf) with a request to disclose my security details in full.
                                            If I receive any such
                                            request from anyone (even if they are using Euro Exim Bank’s name and logo

                                        <p>1. There may be other third-party banks that apply charges in effecting the

                                            which may be deducted from the amount transferred by me or from funds
                                            received by me via an
                                            International Payment. This will mean that the sum received by the
                                            beneficiary or by me may be less
                                            than the amount I have sent or received. b) If any charges are passed back
                                            to Euro Exim Bank by a
                                            third-party bank, Euro Exim Bank reserves the right to debit my account with

                                            as having been received on the following working day. If my Payment
                                            Instruction is an instruction to

                                            made using a card and PIN,

                                            that instruction is
                                            actually received by us; or </p>

                                        <p>b. If the Payment Instruction is received by us after 5pm, it will be treated
                                            as having been received
                                            on the following working; or </p>

                                        <p>c. If my Payment Instruction specifies that the payment is to take place on a

                                            specified, unless that day is a non-working day (in which case the following
                                            working day will
                                            apply).</p>

                                            account(s) or affairs, and</p>

                                        <p>3. My payment instructions will only be accepted by Euro Exim Bank after my

                                            been accepted and it passes any further authenticity checks.</p>

                                        <p>4. Euro Exim Bank may refuse to act upon a payment instruction, for example,
                                            if it exceeds the limit
                                            that Euro Exim Bank has set for such an instruction, or if Euro Exim Bank
                                            knows of or suspects a
                                            breach of my Security Details. If Euro Exim Bank decided to decrease my
                                            default maximum limits at
                                            any time, Euro Exim Bank will override any limits that may be above my new
                                            maximum limits. To
                                            increase you limits at any time, please call Euro Exim Bank.</p>


                                        <p>5. Euro Exim Bank will not be responsible if the circumstances giving rise to
                                            an incorrect payment or
                                            transfer, or a payment or transfer not being made were due to abnormal and
                                            unforeseeable
                                            circumstances beyond Euro Exim Bank’s control, the consequences of which
                                            would have been unavoidable
                                            despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>

                                        <p>6. Euro Exim Bank may, at any time, suspend my access to the Service. Euro
                                            Exim Bank will normally
                                            give you advance notice if Euro Exim Bank is going to suspend you use of the
                                            Service.</p>

                                        <p>7. Euro Exim Bank will tell you why we are taking this action, but Euro Exim
                                            Bank will not give me
                                            notice or details of the reason for the suspension if this would compromise
                                            Euro Exim Bank’s
                                            reasonable security measures, or if it is unlawful to do so. Euro Exim Bank
                                            may occasionally suspend
                                            my use of the Service without notifying me where Euro Exim Bank has been
                                            unable to contact me in
                                            advance. Euro Exim Bank may also suspend my use of the Service due to local
                                            legal obligations that
                                            applies to Euro Exim Bank.</p>

                                        <p>8. Euro Exim Bank will use reasonable efforts to inform me without undue
                                            delay through the Service
                                            and/or our website, if any service under the Service is not available.</p>

                                        <p>9. Euro Exim Bank will not always carry out a payment or transfer instruction
                                            immediately following
                                            it being requested by me. Some matters may take time to process and my
                                            instruction may only be
                                            processed during normal banking hours.</p>


                                        <h3>Payment Limits</h3>
                                        <p>1. Maximum daily limits apply to the amount of cash I can withdraw using my
                                            card.</p>

                                        <p>2. Euro Exim Bank can refuse any withdrawal or payment from my account, if:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. I do not have enough available money in my account; </p>
                                        <p>b. I have exceeded my maximum daily withdrawal; </p>
                                        <p>c. It may place Euro Exim Bank in breach of any legislation or law;</p>
                                        <p>d. Euro exim Bank suspects it relates to fraud or any other criminal act
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. I am in breach of any of these Conditions.</p>
                                        If Euro Exim Bank refuses to allow a withdrawal or payment from my Account, Euro
                                        Exim Bank will tell me
                                        the following by the end of the next working day after the day Euro Exim Bank
                                        receives my withdrawal or
                                        payment request; <p></p>
                                        <p>a. That Euro Exim Bank has done so;</p>
                                        <p>b. The reason why Euro Exim Bank refused; and </p>
                                        <p> c. If I think Euro Exim Bank has based its decision on mistaken information,
                                            how I can ask Euro Exim
                                            Bank to rectify that mistake.
                                            Euro Exim Bank will not tell me that they are refusing a payment or
                                            withdrawal if the law prevents
                                            Euro Exim Bank from doing so.</p>

                                        <h3>Joint Accounts</h3>

                                        <p>1. In the event of the Customer being a partnership the following additional
                                            provisions apply:-</p>
                                        <p>a. The partners authorize the bank to carry out instructions countermanding
                                            payment of cheques, bills
                                            of exchange, promissory notes or other orders for payment when such
                                            instructions are given by any
                                            person who is authorized to sign the mandate whether or not that person has
                                            signed the original
                                            payment instruction.</p>
                                        <p>b. The partners authorize the Bank to make advances with or without security
                                            by way of overdraft,
                                            loan or any other manner on the request of partners for the time being made
                                            in accordance with the
                                            mandate, and to discount bills or promissory notes on the request of the
                                            partners for the time being
                                            made in accordance with the mandate.</p>
                                        <p>c. The partners authorize the Bank to accept by way of pledge or deposit as
                                            security or for safe
                                            custody anything belonging to the partnership on the instructions on the
                                            partners for the time being

                                        <p>e. Upon any change in the constitution of the partnership, the partners will
                                            sign a new mandate.</p>
                                        <p>f. A mandate remains in force and may be acted upon by the Bank until it has
                                            either been revoked in
                                            writing by all or any of the signatories or until it has been replaced by a
                                            new mandate and such
                                            revocation or new mandate has reached the Bank and not until that event has
                                            happened, the Bank will
                                            be responsible for acting according to the original mandate.</p>

                                            International Payment. This will mean that the sum received by the
                                            beneficiary or by me may be less
                                            than the amount I have sent or received. b) If any charges are passed back

                                            instruction is actually
                                            received by Euro Exim Bank, except:</p>

                                            as having been received on the following working day. If my Payment
                                            Instruction is an instruction to

                                            made using a card and PIN,

                                            that instruction is
                                            actually received by us; or </p>

                                        <p>b. If the Payment Instruction is received by us after 5pm, it will be treated
                                            as having been received
                                            on the following working; or </p>

                                        <p>c. If my Payment Instruction specifies that the payment is to take place on a
                                            specific day or on the
                                            last day of a certain period, then Euro Exim Bank will treat it as having

                                            specified, unless that day is a non-working day (in which case the following
                                            working day will
                                            apply).</p>

                                        <p>a. Rely and act upon all apparently valid payment or transfer instructions as
                                            properly authorised
                                            through the Service, even if it may conflict with any other mandate given at
                                            any time concerning you
                                            account(s) or affairs, and</p>
                                        <p>b. Debit my account(s) with any amount I have paid, transferred or incurred
                                            in accordance with the
                                            instruction.</p>

                                        <p>3. My payment instructions will only be accepted by Euro Exim Bank after my
                                            Security Details have
                                            been accepted and it passes any further authenticity checks.</p>

                                        <p>4. Euro Exim Bank may refuse to act upon a payment instruction, for example,
                                            if it exceeds the limit
                                            that Euro Exim Bank has set for such an instruction, or if Euro Exim Bank
                                            knows of or suspects a
                                            breach of my Security Details. If Euro Exim Bank decided to decrease my
                                            default maximum limits at
                                            any time, Euro Exim Bank will override any limits that may be above my new
                                            maximum limits. To
                                            increase you limits at any time, please call Euro Exim Bank.</p>


                                        <p>5. Euro Exim Bank will not be responsible if the circumstances giving rise to
                                            an incorrect payment or
                                            transfer, or a payment or transfer not being made were due to abnormal and
                                            unforeseeable
                                            circumstances beyond Euro Exim Bank’s control, the consequences of which
                                            would have been unavoidable
                                            despite all efforts to the contrary.</p>

                                        <p>6. Euro Exim Bank may, at any time, suspend my access to the Service. Euro
                                            Exim Bank will normally
                                            give you advance notice if Euro Exim Bank is going to suspend you use of the
                                            Service.</p>

                                        <p>7. Euro Exim Bank will tell you why we are taking this action, but Euro Exim
                                            Bank will not give me
                                            notice or details of the reason for the suspension if this would compromise
                                            Euro Exim Bank’s
                                            reasonable security measures, or if it is unlawful to do so. Euro Exim Bank
                                            may occasionally suspend
                                            my use of the Service without notifying me where Euro Exim Bank has been
                                            unable to contact me in
                                            advance. Euro Exim Bank may also suspend my use of the Service due to local
                                            legal obligations that
                                            applies to Euro Exim Bank.</p>

                                        <p>8. Euro Exim Bank will use reasonable efforts to inform me without undue
                                            delay through the Service
                                            and/or our website, if any service under the Service is not available.</p>

                                        <p>9. Euro Exim Bank will not always carry out a payment or transfer instruction
                                            immediately following
                                            it being requested by me. Some matters may take time to process and my
                                            instruction may only be
                                            processed during normal banking hours.</p>


                                        <h3>Payment Limits</h3>
                                        <p>1. Maximum daily limits apply to the amount of cash I can withdraw using my
                                            card.</p>

                                        <p>2. Euro Exim Bank can refuse any withdrawal or payment from my account, if:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>a. I do not have enough available money in my account; </p>
                                        <p>b. I have exceeded my maximum daily withdrawal; </p>
                                        <p>c. It may place Euro Exim Bank in breach of any legislation or law;</p>
                                        <p>d. Euro exim Bank suspects it relates to fraud or any other criminal act
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. I am in breach of any of these Conditions.</p>
                                        <p>3. If Euro Exim Bank refuses to allow a withdrawal or payment from my
                                            Account, Euro Exim Bank will
                                            tell me the following by the end of the next working day after the day Euro
                                            Exim Bank receives my
                                            withdrawal or payment request; </p>
                                        <p>a. That Euro Exim Bank has done so;</p>
                                        <p>b. The reason why Euro Exim Bank refused; and </p>
                                        <p> c. If I think Euro Exim Bank has based its decision on mistaken information,
                                            how I can ask Euro Exim
                                            Bank to rectify that mistake.
                                            Euro Exim Bank will not tell me that they are refusing a payment or
                                            withdrawal if the law prevents
                                            Euro Exim Bank from doing so.</p>

                                        <h3>Joint Accounts</h3>
                                        <p>1. The holders of a joint account authorises Euro Exim Bank to pay or
                                            deliver, or to the order of,
                                            the survivors or survivor or the executors or administrators of such

                                        <p>b. Any mandate intimation, notice, request or letter varying the original
                                            instruction regarding the

                                            authorized to operate on the
                                            Joint Account. This applies with equal force to authenticating material

                                        <h3>Partnership Accounts</h3>
                                        <p>1. In the event of the Customer being a partnership the following additional
                                            provisions apply:-</p>
                                        <p>a. The partners authorize the bank to carry out instructions countermanding
                                            payment of cheques, bills
                                            of exchange, promissory notes or other orders for payment when such
                                            instructions are given by any
                                            person who is authorized to sign the mandate whether or not that person has
                                            signed the original
                                            payment instruction.</p>
                                        <p>b. The partners authorize the Bank to make advances with or without security
                                            by way of overdraft,
                                            loan or any other manner on the request of partners for the time being made
                                            in accordance with the
                                            mandate, and to discount bills or promissory notes on the request of the
                                            partners for the time being
                                            made in accordance with the mandate.</p>
                                        <p>c. The partners authorize the Bank to accept by way of pledge or deposit as
                                            security or for safe
                                            custody anything belonging to the partnership on the instructions on the
                                            partners for the time being
                                            made in accordance with the mandate, and to deliver upon the said
                                            instructions anything as accepted
                                            or held on account of the partnership.</p>
                                        <p>d. All liability of the partners to the Bank is joint and several.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>e. Upon any change in the constitution of the partnership, the partners will
                                            sign a new mandate.</p>
                                        <p>f. A mandate remains in force and may be acted upon by the Bank until it has
                                            either been revoked in
                                            writing by all or any of the signatories or until it has been replaced by a
                                            new mandate and such
                                            revocation or new mandate has reached the Bank and not until that event has
                                            happened, the Bank will
                                            be responsible for acting according to the original mandate.</p>

                                        <h3>Security Obligations</h3>
